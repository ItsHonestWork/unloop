# About
I’m a solo developer driven by a deep desire to help people with OCD. Having family members who struggle with this disorder, I’ve witnessed firsthand the challenges and the overwhelming impact it can have on their lives. Unloop was born out of a personal mission: to create a tool that not only supports individuals with OCD but also provides therapists with better resources to help their patients.

Privacy is just as important as the tools themselves. In a world where personal data is often exploited, I built Unloop to protect your privacy. No tracking, no cloud storage—your data stays encrypted and entirely on your device.

If you believe in this mission, please consider supporting me through the donate button. Every contribution helps me continue improving Unloop and offering it to those who need it most.
