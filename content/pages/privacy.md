# **Privacy Policy**

This app is designed with your privacy as a **top priority**. It operates entirely offline, meaning none of your data is transmitted to or stored on any external servers or cloud services. All data you log, including events, obsessions, compulsions, and other app activity, is stored locally on your device and encrypted for maximum security.

### **Data Collection**

- **No Personal Data Collected**: We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII), and you are not required to register or create an account to use the app.
- **Data Logging**: The app allows you to log events (triggers), obsessions (fears), and rituals (compulsions). This data remains stored only on your device.
- **Offline Functionality**: The app functions entirely offline, and no data will be shared or sent over the internet.
- **Encryption**: All user data is encrypted locally using industry-standard encryption protocols to ensure your information is protected and secure.

### **Data Usage**

The data you log is used solely to provide insights into your OCD patterns via the app’s evaluation tools. It helps you track and analyze frequency, correlations, and time-based trends of your OCD-related activity.

### **Data Sharing**

- **No Third-Party Data Sharing**: Since the app does not collect, store, or transmit data externally, no data is shared with third parties.
- **Export Data Option**: You can always export your data in a readable format (such as CSV or PDF), allowing you to share it manually with healthcare providers if you wish. Alternatively, you can export the data in an encrypted format for secure transfer between your devices, ensuring that your sensitive information remains protected during the process.

### **Data Retention**

All data remains on your device for as long as you choose to use the app. You can delete your logged data at any time by using the delete feature within the app settings.

### **Security**

To protect your data:

- **Local Encryption**: Your data is encrypted with a password you can modify in the settings. The password is generated when the app is installed and stored securely on your device.
- **No Internet Connectivity**: The app works offline, meaning it cannot send or receive data over the internet, further ensuring your privacy.

### **Recommendation for Data Security**

Despite all the efforts invested in securing your data, we recommend that you use words or phrases that only make sense to you when logging events, obsessions, and compulsions. This way, in the unlikely event of a data breach, anyone accessing the data would only see a series of relationships between entries rather than the actual content of your sensitive information. This additional layer of personalization enhances your data privacy and security.

### **User Rights**

- **Access**: You have full control over your data. You can view and analyze the logged information within the app at any time.
- **Deletion**: You can delete all logged data directly from the app, ensuring that no residual data remains on your device.

### **Changes to the Privacy Policy**

Any future updates to the privacy policy will be included within the app’s update notes. Since the app operates offline, no automatic changes to data handling will occur without your explicit consent.
