  <h1>Overview</h1>
    Unloop empowers individuals with <strong>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</strong> to effortlessly log triggers, obsessions, and compulsions. With a focus on speed and simplicity, Unloop helps you <strong>track patterns</strong> without disruption, offering powerful insights through <strong>personalized analysis</strong>, graphs, and charts. Completely offline and secure, your data is <strong>encrypted</strong> and stored solely on your device‚Äî<u>no cloud, no accounts, no cookies, no compromises</u>. But, if needed, you can export your data in CSV format to share with healthcare providers at your discretion.

That said, I recommend always using pseudonyms or phrases that only have meaning to you, so you can protect your privacy under any circumstances.

## Why
As someone increasingly frustrated by the capitalist trend of trading your soul ‚Äîyour data, your privacy‚Äî for so-called ‚Äúfree‚Äù tools, especially in something as crucial as mental health, I created Unloop to reclaim that space. With personal ties to people suffering from OCD, I wanted to offer a solution that prioritizes you, your privacy, and your peace of mind. No tracking, no cloud, no cookies, no accounts. Just a simple, useful tool built for you and your recovery. 
Everything is local, and your data stays yours. 

This is something genuinely created for the people üå±.
