## Why Unloop Exists
At its core, Unloop was created with two essential goals: to **support** your **recovery** and to **protect** your **privacy**. Living with **OCD** can be an overwhelming and difficult journey‚Äîoften isolating and misunderstood. I‚Äôve experienced this up close, watching family members struggle daily with the relentless challenges of OCD. The **constant loop** of intrusive thoughts, obsessions, and rituals is exhausting, and finding a tool that helps identify and analyze these patterns can be life-changing.

Just as important as recovery, though, is your **privacy**. In a world where data is treated as currency, especially with so-called ‚Äúfree‚Äù tools, I wanted Unloop to be different. I was frustrated by the growing trend of trading your soul‚Äî your privacy‚Äî for services, especially when it comes to something as personal as mental health. That‚Äôs why Unloop requires no registration, has no tracking cookies, and no cloud storage. Your data stays local on your device, fully encrypted, and only you have access to it. This way, you can focus entirely on your recovery, confident that your **information is secure**.

Unloop is here to support your journey, working hand-in-hand with your therapist by combining personalized insights with complete privacy.

üå± Your recovery and your data‚Äîcompletely in your control.
